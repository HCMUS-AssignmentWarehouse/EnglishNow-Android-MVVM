The more using Technology in this below list, the better.

## Software Architectural pattern:
* [ ] Model-View-Controller (MVC)
* [ ] Model-View-Presenter (MVP)
* [x] Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)

## Design Pattern: 
### Creational:
 * [x] Dependency Injection: (DI) is a design pattern that demonstrates how to create loosely coupled classes. 
 * [x] Builder: constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation.
 * [ ] Abstract factory: groups object factories that have a common theme.
 * [ ] Factory method: creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
 * [ ] Prototype: creates objects by cloning an existing object.
 * [x] Singleton: restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.
 * [ ] Create new object by instance: 
 * [x] Abstract class. 
 
### Structural:
 * [ ] Composite: composes zero-or-more similar objects so that they can be manipulated as one object.
 * [x] Adapter (also known as Wrapper): allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class.
 * [ ] Facade: provides a simplified interface to a large body of code: http://androidexample1.blogspot.com/2015/11/facade-design-pattern.html/
 * [x] Repository: can be viewed as a special kind of Fa√ßade. For Mediating between the domain and data mapping layers using a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23213543/what-type-is-repository-pattern-in

### Behavioral:
 * [ ] Iterator: accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/iterator_pattern.htm
 * [x] Observer: is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
 * [ ] Strategy: allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/370258/real-world-example-of-the-strategy-pattern
 * [ ] Template method: defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its subclasses to provide concrete behavior: https://dzone.com/articles/design-patterns-template-method
 
## Middleware:
### Transport:
 * [ ] Distributed object: Handle, register, dictionary,..
 * [ ] Message.
