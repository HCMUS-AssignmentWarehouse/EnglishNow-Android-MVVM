The more using Technology in this below list, the better.

## Software Architectural pattern:
* Model-View-Controller (MVC)
* Model-View-Presenter (MVP)
* Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)

## Design Pattern: 
### Creational:
 * Dependency Injection: (DI) is a design pattern that demonstrates how to create loosely coupled classes. 
 * Builder: constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation.
 * Abstract factory: groups object factories that have a common theme.
 * Builder: constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation.
 * Factory method: creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
 * Prototype: creates objects by cloning an existing object.
 * Singleton: restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.
 * Create new object by instance: 
 * Abstract class: 
 
### Structural:
 * Composite: composes zero-or-more similar objects so that they can be manipulated as one object.
 * Adapter (also known as Wrapper): allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class.
 * Facade: provides a simplified interface to a large body of code.
 
### Behavioral:
 * Iterator: accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
 * Observer: is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
 * Strategy: allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime.
 
## Middleware:
### Transport:
 * Distributed object: Handle, register, dictionary,..
 * Message.
