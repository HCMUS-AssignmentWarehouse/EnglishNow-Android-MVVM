The more using Technology in this below list, the better.

## Software Architectural pattern:
* [ ] Model-View-Controller ([MVC][1])
* [ ] Model-View-Presenter ([MVP][2])
* [x] Model-View-ViewModel ([MVVM][3])

## Programming paradigms
* [x] [Reactive programming][4]: Programming with asynchronous data streams. In computing, reactive programming is an asynchronous programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change. 

## Design Pattern: 
### Creational:
 * [x] [Dependency Injection (DI)][5]: Is a design pattern that demonstrates how to create loosely coupled classes. 
 * [x] [Builder][6]: constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation.
 * [ ] [Abstract factory][7]: groups object factories that have a common theme.
 * [ ] [Factory method][8]: creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
 * [ ] [Prototype][9]: creates objects by cloning an existing object.
 * [x] [Singleton][10]: restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.
 * [ ] Create new object by instance: 
 * [x] Abstract class. 
 
### Structural:
 * [ ] [Composite][11]: composes zero-or-more similar objects so that they can be manipulated as one object.
 * [x] [Adapter][12] (also known as Wrapper): allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class.
 * [x] [ViewHolder][13]: used for View caching - Holder (arbitrary) object holds child widgets of each row and when row is out of View then findViewById() won't be called but View will be recycled and widgets will be obtained from Holder
 * [x] [Facade][14]: provides a simplified interface to a large body of code: 
 * [x] [Repository][15]: can be viewed as a special kind of Fa√ßade. For Mediating between the domain and data mapping layers using a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects. 
 * [x] [Marker interface][16]: used with languages that provide run-time type information about objects. It provides a means to associate metadata with a class where the language does not have explicit support for such metadata.

### Behavioral:
 * [ ] [Iterator][17]: accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
 * [x] [Observer][18]: is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
 * [x] [Strategy][19]: allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime
 * [ ] [Template method][20]: defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its subclasses to provide concrete behavior.
 
## Middleware:
### Transport:
 * [ ] [Distributed object][21]: Handle, register, dictionary,..
 * [x] [Message][22].
